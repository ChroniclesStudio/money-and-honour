Wooden Scene Props Pack by Adorno

This is LSP. The only limit is that none of the content in this pack must be used for commercial purposes. 
No profit must be made from this in any way. It must not be sold separately or as part of other content in any shape or form,
including retexturing, resizing, or even combining the content with other content. I should not have to be this specific. Don't sell it!

------------------

This pack contains 100+ wooden scene props, all on mainly 2 texture sheets sized 2048 x 1024 pixels. Diffuse, normal map and specular map.
Also 2 smaller texture sheets sized 512 x 512 pixels, only for the windmill sails.
There are many small props meant to "decorate" scenes, but also larger props, like gatehouses, walls, bridges, houses, barn, windmill, an arena etc. 
It's mainly suited for medieval or fantasy settings, but several models can also be used for an ancient, or even a modern setting. Take a look.

- Most models have more vertices than similar native models, so a few should be used carefully in large scenes.

- All models use the same shader - for exterior. If you want to use some of the models in interior scenes simply change the shader.

INSTALLATION:

I don't do scripting. So there are no Python files. You must install these yourself. I included the scene_props entries though. So it can easily be done with text files.
