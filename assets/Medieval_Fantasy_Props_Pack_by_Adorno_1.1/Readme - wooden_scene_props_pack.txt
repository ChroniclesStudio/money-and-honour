Medieval Fantasy Props Pack by Adorno

This is LSP. The only limit is that none of the content in this pack must be used for commercial purposes. 
No profit must be made from this in any way. It must not be sold separately or as part of other content in any shape or form,
including retexturing, resizing, or even combining the content with other content.

------------------

This pack contains 68 exterior scene props on 11 materials and 33 textures. It's called "fantasy", but very light fantasy, and all models have a realistic look, so to speak.
A model of the old (Anglo-Saxon) Escomb church is included and is historical.
Apart from that the models are mainly castle/fort modules and houses, as well as towers, walls - big and small  - stairs, a bridge, a basilica, a large castle, 2 mansions, and minor items like rubble, stairs, a wooden fence, and more.
Most notably many of the models are red brick buildings, which is not that common in vanilla Warband and mods.

The wood texture used in this pack is very similar to the one used in my Wooden Scene Props Pack, so they go well together, if that has interest:

INSTALLATION:

I don't do scripting. So there are no Python files. You must install these yourself. I included the scene_props entries though. So it can easily be done with text files.
