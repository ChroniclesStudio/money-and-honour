Polished Landscapes - Warband version

How to install:
1 - install M&B to another folder - for example "M&B_Polished_Landscapes" This mod will change some files that are not moddable, so it's better to have another game installation.
3 - from PL_Warband archive unpack Polished_Landscapes folder into Modules folder (just like any other mod).
4 - [b]IMPORTANT[/b] - place flora_kinds.txt and ground_specs.txt from PL_warband archive into \Mount&Blade\Data folder.


Some simple rules:
Don't use this mod/objects/textures in other projects/mods without my permission.
Don't modify models or textures from this mod without my permission.
Don't use those object/textures in your mods without including credits.
If you want to use this mod "outside" M&B modding community - ask me first.
