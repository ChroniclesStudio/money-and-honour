#  Each trigger contains the following fields:
# 1) Check interval: How frequently this trigger will be checked
# 2) Delay interval: Time to wait before applying the consequences of the trigger
#    After its conditions have been evaluated as true.
# 3) Re-arm interval. How much time must pass after applying the consequences of the trigger for the trigger to become active again.
#    You can put the constant ti_once here to make sure that the trigger never becomes active again after it fires once.
# 4) Conditions block (list). This must be a valid operation block. See header_operations.py for reference.
#    Every time the trigger is checked, the conditions block will be executed.
#    If the conditions block returns true, the consequences block will be executed.
#    If the conditions block is empty, it is assumed that it always evaluates to true.
# 5) Consequences block (list). This must be a valid operation block. See header_operations.py for reference.
